## 📌 Project Overview
Early detection of breast cancer is critical for improving survival rates. This project aims to assist medical professionals by automating the labor-intensive task of analyzing all data about breast cells like radius mean, smoothness mean, area mean, radius worst etc.

### Key Features:
1. Uses two Machine Learning models to predict more valid.
2. Uses well-prepared dataset
3. Categorizes tumors into "Benign" or "Malignant"


## 🧬 Architecture

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree


## 📊 Dataset
The models were trained using the dataset about the breast cells

* **Total Samples:** 569
* **Classes:** Malignant, Benign
* **Preprocessing:** Data divided by two parts Test and Train

Training: 70%-80%
Testing: 20%-30%
